# MRI-Reinforcement-Learning
The dataset for the work is private and therefore is not uploaded. Code is for demonstration purposes only.

This work was completed for my Master's Thesis.

It uses RL, specifically a deep Q-network and a double deep Q network to find edema in the foot and ankle region of MRIs. I also segment the calcaneus bone with similar methods. Please see the pdf for more details.
